# Luis Osuna's Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! The project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a Cloud Engineer. It is built using **Create React App (CRA)** and hosted on **AWS**. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is managed with **Terragrunt**.

The portfolio is live at [luisosuna.com](https://luisosuna.com).

- **AWS Hosting**: Hosted on AWS using S3 for static site hosting and CloudFront as a CDN.
- **IaC with Terragrunt**: Infrastructure provisioning and management handled through Terragrunt and Terraform.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions automate deployment to AWS.
- **Custom Domain**: Available at [luisosuna.com](https://luisosuna.com).
